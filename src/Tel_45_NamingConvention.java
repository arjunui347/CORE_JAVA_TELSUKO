    Java naming conventions are standard guidelines designed to make code more readable and maintainable by providing
    immediate information about the identifier's function (e.g., whether it is a class, variable, or constant).
    The Java compiler does not enforce these conventions, but all professional developers are expected to follow them. [1, 2, 3]

    The primary conventions are based on different letter cases for different types of identifiers: [3, 4, 5]

| Component  | Convention | Example  |

| Packages | All lowercase, using reverse domain name structure. Words are separated by dots. | java.util, com.mycompany.project |
| Classes | PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized). Names should be descriptive nouns. | String, ImageSprite, CustomerAccount  |
| Interfaces | PascalCase. Names should often be adjectives ending in "able" or "ible" (e.g., Runnable, Serializable), or nouns for collection types (e.g., List, Map). |  |
| Methods | lowerCamelCase (first letter lowercase, subsequent internal words capitalized). Names should be verbs describing an action. | run(), getBackground(), calculateTax() |
| Variables | lowerCamelCase. Names should be short, meaningful nouns. Single-character names (i, j, k) are acceptable for temporary loop counters. | firstName, orderNumber, int i |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (all uppercase with words separated by underscores ). These must be declared with . | MAX_WIDTH, PI_VALUE, DEFAULT_TASK_EXECUTOR_BEAN_NAME |

General Principles

• Be Descriptive: Choose meaningful names that indicate the intent of their use. Avoid vague or single-letter names except for temporary variables.
• Use Whole Words: Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms unless they are much more widely used than their long form (e.g., , , ).
• Follow Java Rules: Identifiers are case-sensitive, cannot be keywords, cannot start with a digit, and cannot contain spaces. [6, 7, 10, 11]
